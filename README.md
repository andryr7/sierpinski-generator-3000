# Sierpiński Generator 3000

Sierpiński Generator 3000 is an online fractal drawing tool / inside joke / training project I built after being inspired by some video I saw online:

It is built on React.js and uses an dynamically generated svg as a canvas.
The website's looks are very strongly inspired by vaporwave aesthetics, and accompanied by a short music loop I made with Ableton Live.
